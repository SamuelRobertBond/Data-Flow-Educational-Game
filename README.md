# Data-Flow-Educational-Game
This was a class project I did for my software security and engineering course at Stockton University. Our team had to make a program with the purpose of educating users on a topic of computer science. We used an MVC design in order to make it easier to divide the work. I was in charge of developing a game that would mimic concepts in computer science. The full project should be in a zip file in the repository, but the other files are solely to display the game that I created. I may update it occasionally as there are some bugs I would like to fix and mechanics that I wanted to add. This was my first HTML / CSS / JavaScript project so it is a little rough around the edges, but I do think that I did a decent job.
